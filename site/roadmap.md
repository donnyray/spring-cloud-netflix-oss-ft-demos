# Roadmap

The Hytrix Demo project currently focuses on failure mode handling
characteristics using Neflix-OSS based on static latency bottlenecks.

Ideally we want to expand to additional scenarios and failure modes.

## More Dynamic Failure Handling

- Non-deterministic (randomized) failures
- Driving failure mode re-configuration through load controller 
(dedicated actuator controller)
- Configuration Repo as gitsubmodule?

## Automated Tests

- Add automated Test Cases for deterministic failures

## Additional Failure Mode Handling

- Runtime Exception Injection
- Resource depletion (stretch)
    - Memory inflation
    - CPU spin
    - I/O
    - Network
- Inject multiple failures in order
- Investigate use of Netflix Chaos Engineering toolset

## Potential scenarios

- Resource depletion
    - CPU queuing, saturation -> impacts liveness
    - Out-of-memory -> Process termination or indeterminate state
        - Java
        - Process
    - I/O bottlenecks -> impacts liveness
    - File Descriptors (Linux) -> Runtime exceptions

## Enhanced Demonstrations

- Trusted client demo
- Demo each hystrix failure mode
    - Runtime Exception
    - Timeout (Untrusted Client only)
    - Load shedding
        - Thread Pools
        - Semaphore
- Simulate production peak load profile with Jmeter (Ultimate Thread 
Group)

## Deployments

- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes
- Pivotal Cloud Foundry
